# Components

## Heading 
Use this to organize your content and create a hierarchy for scannability. Use `Heading one` for the main title, `Heading two` for subheadings, and so on.

- **Code**
```
# Heading level 1
## Heading level 2
### Heading level 3
#### Heading level 4
##### Heading level 5
###### Heading level 6

```

**Result**
# Heading level 1
## Heading level 2
### Heading level 3
#### Heading level 4
##### Heading level 5
###### Heading level 6

## Lists
Use this to present items in a specific sequence (ordered list) or without order (unordered list). 


#### Unordered list
- **Code**
```
- The first level of the hierarchy is for *purpose*.
  This is always `44'`, as per the BIP44 specification.
- The second level of the hierarchy is for the *registered coin type*.
  - For Rootstock Mainnet, this should be `137'`, as per the
    [SLIP-44](https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0044.md "Registered coin types for BIP-0044")
    specification.
  - For Rootstock Testnet, this should be `37310'`, as per the
    [RSKIP-57](https://github.com/rsksmart/RSKIPs/blob/master/IPs/RSKIP57.md "Derivation Path for Hierarchical Deterministic Wallets")
    specification.
- The final level of the hierarchy is for *index*: Addresses are numbered from index 0 in sequentially increasing manner. This number is used as child index in [BIP32 derivation](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki#specification-key-derivation "Hierarchical Deterministic Wallets - Key Derivation"). Public derivation is used at this level.

[The Smart Bitcoin (RBTC)](#) is the native currency in Rootstock and it is used to pay for the gas required for the execution of transactions. It is pegged 1:1 with Bitcoin, which means in Rootstock there are exactly 21M RBTC. A Powpeg allows the transfer of bitcoins from the Bitcoin blockchain to the Rootstock blockchain and vice-versa

      LRootstock is the first and longest-lasting Bitcoin sidechain. It is the only layer 2 solution that combines the security of Bitcoin's proof of work with Ethereum's smart contract capabilities. The platform is open-source, EVM-compatible, and secured by over 60% of Bitcoinâ€™s hashing power, making it the gateway to a vibrant ecosystem of dApps that continues to evolve to become fully trustless.

  </Accordion.Item>
  <Accordion.Item eventKey="1">
    <Accordion.Header as="h3">What is a smart contract?</Accordion.Header>
    <Accordion.Body>
      Smart contracts are digital agreements stored on a blockchain network such as Rootstock and executed automatically without intermediaries. A smart contract allows digital assets to be controlled, exchanged, and transferred. Smart contracts have numerous use cases, such as lending, voting, decentralized payments and exchanges, asset tokenization, etc.

  <Accordion.Item eventKey="2">
    <Accordion.Header as="h3">Is the Rootstock network compatible with the Ethereum network?</Accordion.Header>
    <Accordion.Body>
    - Rootstock is [compatible with the Ethereum blockchain](https://medium.com/iovlabs-innovation-stories/similarities-and-differences-between-rsk-and-ethereum-e480655eff37) at the following layers:
      - EVM compatibility
      - Interprocess connectivity in JSON-RPC
      - Smart contract programming in Solidity
      - JavaScript interface with web3.js
    - The Rootstock virtual machine (RVM) is highly compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Approximately annually, the Ethereum community performs a hard fork to add new functionalities to the blockchain. When these new functionalities align with Rootstock's vision, the community performs a corresponding hard fork to maintain compatibility with the EVM.
    - Additionally, the RVM offers improved features over EVM, such as bridging with Bitcoin and querying the Bitcoin blockchain.
