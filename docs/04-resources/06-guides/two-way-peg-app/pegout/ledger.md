## Performing a peg-out transaction using rLogin(Trezor and Ledger)

​> - Note that we will be using the 2 way peg app on [2 way peg app - Testnet](https://app.2wp.testnet.rootstock.io/) for learning purposes.
> - For transactions using **real tokens**, use the [2 way peg app - Mainnet](https://app.2wp.rootstock.io/) application.
> - We're using Ledger Nano and Trezor One hardware wallets on this tutorial.
> - To use Ledger hardware wallet to create a **peg-in** see [How to perform a peg-in transaction using Ledger](/resources/guides/two-way-peg-app/pegin/ledger/)
> - To use Trezor hardware wallet to create a **peg-in** see [How to perform a peg-in transaction using Trezor](/resources/guides/two-way-peg-app/pegin/trezor/)
